3. Save the changes to update your language preference.

## Advanced Features

### Smart Medicine Timing Recognition

The system is designed to intelligently interpret timing instructions in prescriptions:

* **Specific Times:** Recognizes formats like "9:00 AM", "14:30", "8pm".
* **Meal-based Keywords:** Maps "breakfast" to 8:00 AM, "lunch" to 12:00 PM, "dinner" to 6:00 PM, etc.
* **Special Instructions:** Extracts and includes instructions like "before food", "after meals", etc.

### Enhanced Calendar Events

Calendar events include:
* Medication name and dosage as the event title
* Complete medication details in the event description
* Specific timing based on parsed instructions
* Popup reminder 10 minutes before the scheduled time

## Troubleshooting

* **Google Calendar Authentication:** If events aren't being created, run `python create_event.py` manually to re-authenticate.
* **LLM Issues:** Ensure Ollama is running with the correct model loaded.
* **Translation Errors:** Verify that `translate.json` has valid credentials and the API is enabled.
* **File Access:** Check permissions if encountering file not found errors.

## Security Notes

* User passwords are hashed before storage.
* Google OAuth flow follows security best practices.
* Always keep your credential files (`translate.json`, `tempCredentials.json`, `token.json`) secure.
* Change the Flask secret key from 'your_secret_key_here' in production.

## Future Improvements

* Replace Excel-based user storage with a proper database.
* Add advanced error handling and retry mechanisms.
* Implement more sophisticated user interfaces.
* Add support for additional languages and medical terminology.
* Implement more sophisticated user interfaces.
* Add support for additional languages and medical terminology.
